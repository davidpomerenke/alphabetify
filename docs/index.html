    <p>
      Alphabetify makes learning new alphabets easy.
      Copypaste any text â€“
      the breaking news,
      your favourite book,
      or a piece of homework.
      Alphabetify will transform the text for you.
      It starts with all symbols in your native alphabet,
      then slowly introduces more and more foreign characters.
      You will get used to them and learn the alphabet without any effort.
      Try it!

Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature's changing course, untrimm'd;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;
Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st;
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

      You can optionally specify the input language by adding something like <code>lang=de</code> to the beginning of your input. This will add some minor language-specific optimizations. English is assumed by default, and currently the only other language supported for optimization is German.
