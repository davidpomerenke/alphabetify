  "sample": "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\nThou art more lovely and more temperate:\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\nAnd summer's lease hath all too short a date:\nSometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\nAnd often is his gold complexion dimm'd;\nAnd every fair from fair sometime declines,\nBy chance, or nature's changing course, untrimm'd;\nBut thy eternal summer shall not fade\nNor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;\nNor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,\nWhen in eternal lines to time thou grow'st;\nSo long as men can breathe or eyes can see,\nSo long lives this, and this gives life to thee."
