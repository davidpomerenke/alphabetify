Alphabetify will transform the text for you. It starts with all symbols in your native alphabet, then slowly introduces more and more foreign characters. You will get used to them and learn the alphabet without any effort.</p><p>Try it!</p>",

Feedback from language teachers on how useful the tool is actually in a real-world environment would also be very appreciated.",
  "sample": "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\nThou art more lovely and more temperate:\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\nAnd summer's lease hath all too short a date:\nSometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\nAnd often is his gold complexion dimm'd;\nAnd every fair from fair sometime declines,\nBy chance, or nature's changing course, untrimm'd;\nBut thy eternal summer shall not fade\nNor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;\nNor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,\nWhen in eternal lines to time thou grow'st;\nSo long as men can breathe or eyes can see,\nSo long lives this, and this gives life to thee."
